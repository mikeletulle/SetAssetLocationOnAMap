# SetAssetLocationOnAMap
Simple demo of showing how to set the location of an asset using google maps API

We created a demo to show how they one could allow customers on a DXP site to show their vendor  exactly where they wanted an asset to be placed at their location.
Basically all the code is in one VF page (AssetLocation) and itâ€™s controller. I created a simple LWC (assetLocation) that just pulls that page into an iframe to make it responsive. 
It has a hard coded ID of an asset which you would need to replace.
The VF page as a google maps developer API key that you need to replace as well.
You just need to add two custom number fields to the Asset (Latitude__c and Longitude__c)
 We created a simple flow and a button to launch it on the Asset that brings up the window to set the location.
